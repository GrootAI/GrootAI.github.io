Meta learning can be described as "learning to learn." It means model learns the learning strategy. There is a three main approach in meta learning: metric-based, model-based, and optimization-based. Metric-based approach is easy to use and can be used in any model, so it is popular and well-studied method. In this seminar I briefly introduced metric-based meta learning methods: Matching Netwroks, Prototypical Networks, and Relation Networks.
