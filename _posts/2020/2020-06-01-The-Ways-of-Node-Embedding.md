Graph is one of the most popular object that is in non-euclidean space. One of obstacles before extracting information from Graph is that we cannot find proper representation graph by graph. Recently, there is huge development in learning algorithms for graph structured data. In this talk, we'll study Node2Vec algorithm and DeepWalk,.
