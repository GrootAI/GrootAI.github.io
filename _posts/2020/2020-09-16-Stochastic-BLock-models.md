Learn sparse node embeddings for graphs. These embeddings can be used to identify the
community membership(s) of each node in the graph, as well as for tasks such as link prediction.

In this work, they unify these two directions by developing a sparse variational autoencoder for graphs, 
that retains the interpretability of SBMs, while also enjoying the excellent predictive  performance of graph neural nets
